	Challenge Submission(30 points)
	
		Cyber Command: Learn how to submit challenge answers on the Cyber Skyline Platform.

		Generally, you can enter free-form response and Cyber Skyline's challenge engine will intelligently parse your response. The safest option is to copy any exact text from the source, such that if the answer for a browser & its version should be Chrome 65.0.3325.181 just enter exactly that. Some answer submission boxes will prompt for a specific formatting to help avoid ambiguity.

		Cyber Command: Example 1, if we ask you what's our company name, you can just enter "Cyber Skyline" Go ahead, try it out! (5 pts)
			
			Cyber Skyline
			
		Cyber Command: Correct! Good job so far.

		Cyber Command: Great job! Next up is numeric inputs.
		If we asked you how many States does the United States have? You can actually enter either "50" or "fifty!" Give it a try! (5 pts)

			50
		
		Cyber Command: Correct! Good job so far.

		Cyber Command: Nice!
		Getting IP addresses correct is very important in cybersecurity. So if we ask for an IP address, the input box will actually make sure you're entering a valid IP address. Try submitting the IP address "8.8.8.8" (5 pts)

			8.8.8.8
		
		Cyber Command: Correct! Good job so far.

		Cyber Command: MAC addresses are also just as important to get correct, so we have a hexadecimal input that automatically helps you with entering MAC addresses.
		Try entering the MAC address "00:3e:e1:c4:5d:df" and you'll see that the input box will automatically capitalize the hexadecimal value for you to avoid ambiguity. (5 pts)

			00:3E:E1:C4:5D:DF
			
		Cyber Command: Correct! Good job so far.

		Cyber Command: Hexadecimal can also be used for other things - it's a good way to represent binary values that aren't easy for human eyes to read - and for these situations, it doesn't make sense to have colons separating each byte, so we also have a plain hexadecimal input. Try submitting: "5ac4841b9000090dbefdda26" (5 pts)
	
			5AC4841B9000090DBEFDDA26
		
		Cyber Command: Correct! Good job so far.

		Cyber Command: Awesome! Finally, we have a date time picker.
		Cyber Skyline uses ISO8601 style date representation and a 24 hour time representation. So January 30th, 2018 9:45pm would be "2018-01-30 21:45"
	
		If that sounds confusing, don't worry, we have a great date and time picker to help you enter the date and time. Simply click into the input box and you'll get a small popup modal. Try using the popup modal to select April 15th, 2018 11:30pm (5 pts)	
	
			2018-04-15 23:30
		
		Cyber Command: Correct! Good job so far.

		Cyber Command: You are done. Thank you for completing this mission. Onto the next challenge!
