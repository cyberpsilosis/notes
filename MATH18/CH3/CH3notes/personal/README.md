# **Binomial Distribution**
### A **binomial experiment** has **two outcomes**
```
success or failure
```
### **n = the number of trials** 
```
Also, the number of times you have an experiment.
```
### **p = probability of the success**
### **q = probability of the failure**
```
or complement p=1-q
```
### **Basic probability calculations for the “and” and “or”**
```
P(A and B) = P(A) x P(B)
P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)
```
1. Let’s look into a situation of having three children which will either be a boy or a girl. Let’s make a P(B) = .512
- What is the probability of having a boy and not a boy?
```
The probability of having a boy - p = .512
The probability of not having a boy - p = .488
```
- Write out all the possibilities of having three kids.
```
(K=0) All Girls
(K=1) 2 Girls and 1 Boy
(K=2) 1 Girl and 2 Boys
(K=3) All Boys
```
- What is the probability of each outcome?
```
P(X=0) is 0.1162
P(X=1) is 0.3658
P(X=2) is 0.3838
P(X=0) is 0.1342
