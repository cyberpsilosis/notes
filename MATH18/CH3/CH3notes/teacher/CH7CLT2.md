# **CLT with binomial population distribution notes**
## **Example #1:**
**The population distribution is a binomial distribution with n=10 and p=.25.**

a. Write out a table for the population distribution.  Draw a sketch of what it looks like.<br>

b. What is more likely to happen 2 successes or 8 successes?
```
2 successes is more likely to happen than 8 successes.
```
c. What is the probability of 7 or more successes?
```
P(X ≥ 7) = .0035
```
d. What would the sampling distribution look like, if n=30?
```
Normal Curve
```
e. What is the probability of 7 or more successes, for an average of 30 samples?
```
mean = n times p
normalCDF(bottom,large number,mean,standard deviation/square root of sample size)
normalCDF(7,100,2.5,[(10x.25x.75)/30])  =  1.22 x n to the -72 ≈ 0
