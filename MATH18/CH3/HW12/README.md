## **Central Limit Theorem Homework (adapted from Kozak)**

**Problem #1:**

A random variable is not normally distributed, but it is mound shaped. It has a mean of 14 and a standard deviation of 3.

a.) If you take a sample of size 10, can you say what the shape of the sampling distribution for the sample mean is? Why?

b.) For a sample of size 10, state the mean of the sample mean and the standard deviation of the sample mean.

c.) If you take a sample of size 35, can you say what the shape of the sampling distribution of the sample mean is? Why?

d.) For a sample of size 35, state the mean of the sample mean and the standard deviation of the sample mean.

 

**Problem #2:**

The mean starting salary for nurses is $67,694 nationally ("Staff nurse -," 2013). The standard deviation is approximately $10,333. The starting salary is not normally distributed but it is mound shaped. A sample of 42 starting salaries for nurses is taken.

a.) What could the sample distribution look like? 

b.) What does the sampling distribution look like?

c.) What is the mean and standard deviation of the sampling distribution?

d.) Find the probability that the sample mean of 42 nurses is more than $75,000.

f.) Find the probability that the sample mean of 42 nurses is less than $60,000.

g.) If you did find a sample mean of more than $75,000 would you find that unusual? What could you conclude?

 

**Problem #3:**

The size of fish is very important to commercial fishing. A study conducted in 2012 found the length of Atlantic cod caught in nets in Karlskrona to have a mean of 49.9 cm and a standard deviation of 3.74 cm (Ovegard, Berndt & Lunneryd, 2012). The length of fish is normally distributed. A sample of 15 fish is taken.

a.) What is the shape of the sample distribution?

b.) What is the shape of the sampling distribution of the sample mean? Why?

c.) Find the probability that the length of one Atlantic cod is less than 52 cm.

d.) Find the probability that the average length of 15 Atlantic cod is less than 52 cm.

e) Find the probability that the sample mean length of 15 the Atlantic cod is more than 74 cm.

g.) Find the probability that the mean length of one Atlantic cod is more than 74 cm.

 

**Problem #4:**

In the United States, males between the ages of 40 and 49 eat on average 103.1 g of fat every day with a standard deviation of 4.32 g ("What we eat," 2012). The amount of fat a person eats is not normally distributed but it is relatively mound shaped.

a.) Draw a possible sample distribution and draw a possible sampling distribution.

b.) Find the probability that a sample mean amount of daily fat intake for 35 men age 40-59 in the U.S. is more than 100 g.

c.) Find the probability that a sample mean amount of daily fat intake for 35 men age 40-59 in the U.S. is less than 93 g.

d.) If you found a sample mean amount of daily fat intake for 35 men age 40-59 in the U.S. less than 93 g, what would you conclude?
