**Properties:**
    human-readable
    1033 bytes in size
    not executable

**Command Used:**
 Filter your search results by size. If you have lots of files with similar names, but know the size you are looking for, you can filter our results by size.

find / -size +50M -iname "filename"

    This will return results that are 50 megabytes or larger.
    
    You can use + or - to search for greater or lesser sizes. Omitting the + or - will search for files exactly the specified size.

    You can filter by bytes (c), kilobytes (k), megabytes (M), gigabytes (G), or 512-byte blocks (b). Note that the size flag is case-sensitive.
